*⚠️ This project was created as a learning exercise for an internship to build a note-taking app using React and Vite. I decided to leave it as-is when I stopped working on it ⚠️*

<br/>

NoteApp is a **simple and modern note-taking application** that lets users create, edit, and search notes quickly. It features a clean UI and leverages React for a smooth interactive experience.
